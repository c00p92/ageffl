  "1": "Opening salvo: two evenly matched squads. Edge goes to the team with the steadier RB room—expect a nail-biter decided late Monday.",
  "2": "Revenge game vibes. WR stack looks hot here; if the QB connects deep twice, this could get out of hand. Pick: slight upset.",
  "3": "Low‑scoring rock fight. Watch the DSTs. Whoever avoids turnovers pulls ahead. Leaning toward the safer floor at RB.",
  "4": "Shootout alert. Two elite WR1s on both sides. Red‑zone usage tilts my call—home run potential wins out.",
  "5": "Boom/bust clash. If the boom hits, it’s curtains. Otherwise, slow-and-steady PPR grinders grind out a win. I’ll take volume.",
  "6": "Championship rematch energy. Tiny PF edge and better bench depth swing it. Pencil in a 5–10 point margin."
