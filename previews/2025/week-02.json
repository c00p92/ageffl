{
  "1": "It was a very disappointing Week 1 outing for Chris as he finished #2 in PF, but lost to the #1 team of the week. I don't see that trend continuing as Casey comes in as the next challenger. I better hope I'm right. Winner: Chris",
  "2": "Todd had another strong showing to open the season as he now looks to move to 2-0 against Tony's squad. While I think Tony puts up a good fight he won't have the firepower necessary to overcome Todd's squad. Winner: Todd",
  "3": "This one ends being closer than predictions show, but David ultimately snags the win. Winner: David",
  "4": "Two 1-0 teams face off and only one 2-0 team leaves to claim the top of the leaderboard. Expect a hotly contested fight between these squads as they fight for King of the Hill. Ultimately, Micah comes out with the win to prove his team is (finally) to be feared in this league. Winner: Micah",
  "5": "Dan takes down Edwin in a snore. Unfortunately. Winner: Dan",
  "6": "After dropping the ball against Dan, Kevin's team is desperate to get the win this week against an equally tough opponent. Meanwhile Corey is out to prove he can still get the W with Kittle going down for extended time. I see Kevin pulling this one out in a nail biter to avoid dropping to 0-2. Winner: Kevin"
