  "4": "Not worth the time to type Winner: Micah",
  "5": "Kevin is the most at risk of the teams in the current field. A win and he's in, but should he falter there's sharks in the water waiting for the moment to claim his spot. I think it happens sadly as Kevin loses this game and his playoff positioning right at the buzzer. Winner: Edwin",
