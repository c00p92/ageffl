  "1": "Two heavyweights and championship favorites square off in what we have to assume will be the game of the week. Micah had been the punching bag for quite some time, but now is 2-2 and showed off last week he's a force to be reckoned with. He continues to show out as he shocks Chris' squad and knocks them to 2-3 on the season. Winner: Micah",
  "2": "Todd has been up and down all season long and I expect this week to be no different. However this will be an up week for him as he secures the win against David. Winner: Todd",
  "3": "Corey's whole team is on IR and yet I still expect him to win this matchup. Winner: Corey",
  "4": "Tony gets the W this week after a shocking loss last week. Winner: Tony",
  "5": "Kevin wins in a landslide victory. Winner: Kevin",
  "6": "Two 3-0 teams square off to take the top of the leaderboard. While I'm sure Andre thinks he can sneak out a victory I frankly don't see this one being close. Dan proves he's still the champ for a reason as he makes Andre question if he has enough to get over the hump. Winner: Dan"
