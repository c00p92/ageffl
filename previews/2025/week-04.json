  "3": "It's a moveable wall against a pushable object. Who's gonna win? Probably the least pathetic of these two Winner: Edwin",
  "4": "Oops All IR! Corey's season is in a tailspin at this point and I don't see it stopping now as Tony climbs to 4-0 and feels like a winner in this league for the first time in forever. (Even though he would have lost if his D/ST didn't score God-like numbers last week) Winner: Tony",
  "5": "Sharpie. Winner: Dan",
  "6": "Gonna side with the upset pick on this one. Kevin's team has been close but hasn't quite done enough to show his team can win any given week. I think we see a slight shift this week as he ends Andre's undefeated season. Winner: Kevin"
