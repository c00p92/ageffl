  "1": "Two playoff hopefuls clash in Week 1 looking for a solid start to their season. This should be hotly contested matchup throughout but Todd gets the W as he frequently does against Chris. Winner: Todd",
  "2": "Tony is looking to make a name for himself this season and he can at least avoid being an embarrassment by overcoming DeerHunter's weaker squad in Week 1. Winner: Tony",
  "3": "Micah is looking to come out swinging in Week 1 after being the league's punching bag the last few seasons. Beef fights hard but ultimately does not have enough to overcome Micah's squad. Winner: Micah",
  "4": "Andre has been a perennial standout since the start of the dynasty league. While he had a disappointing end to the season last year he's looking to come out in Week 1 and prove he still belongs near the top. Winner: Andre",
  "5": "Corey and Edwin are two playoff squads that also want to start off the season strong with a W. I think Edwin slips a bit this season as Corey looks to take the next step towards becoming a feared team in this league. Winner: Corey",
  "6": "Dan begins his second title defense against Kevin's upstart squad. Dan's depth should give him the edge here as he starts the season 1-0. Winner: Dan"
