  "1": "Oh it's on! Tony's rag tag bunch of misfits things he can tilt the odds in his favor this week, but he's sorely mistaken. Chris adds another to his W column against Tony in what's been a very unbalanced rivalry. Winner: Chris",
  "2": "Casey's team isn't really worth any extra keystrokes. Winner: Todd",
  "3": "Another bad blood matchup here between two bitter rivals. David would love nothing more than to end Andre's shot at an undefeated season and I think he does just that. David settles his W before SNF hits our screens. Winner: David",
  "4": "Corey's squad is floundering after losing some key contributors now and who else could have the timely matchup than of course fucking Dan. Dan wins. It's not close. Corey trade me your players please so we can stop this evil! Winner: Dan",
  "5": "Kevin finds his weekly team names hilarious without a doubt. What's funnier was Edwin thinking his team would be competitive this season. Winner: Kevin",
  "6": "Micah hasn't had quite the start I think he was expecting. Facing off against Jared's 0-2 squad is good medicine for that though. Micah climbs to 2-1 as Jared continues his winless streak. Winner: Micah"
